Tasks to do:

---  Correct the way the background service is used and how others get a
     connection to it's handle.
---  Replace timer and timertasks with delayed message handlers.
---  Replace way current timer modes are used to be called through an interface.
---  Instead of having the timer run in the background save the state when the 
     app is no longer on top, and restore it when the app restored.  This will
     also restore the state the app was previously in.  This should save a 
     signficant portion of the battery usage.
---  Add class to provide uniform getting of the preferences.
---  Add comment section to timer save window.
---  Add audio notification support
---  Add remaining timer modes.
