Tasks to do:

---  Instead of having the timer run in the background save the state when the 
     app is no longer on top, and restore it when the app restored.  This will
     also restore the state the app was previously in.  This should save a 
     signficant portion of the battery usage.
---  Add comment section to timer save window.
---  Add audio notification support
